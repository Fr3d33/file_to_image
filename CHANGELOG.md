## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Initial release of File to Image Encoder/Decoder
- Command-line interface for both encoding and decoding
- Support for any file type (binary and text files)
- Automatic optimal image dimension calculation
- Manual image dimension specification via command-line arguments
- Smart decoding method for accurate data boundary detection
- Legacy count-based decoding method for compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Detailed help and version information
- Support for files of any size (limited by available memory)
- Lossless round-trip encoding/decoding
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Features
- **Universal File Support**: Encode any file type into PNG images
- **Flexible Dimensions**: Auto-calculate optimal size or specify custom dimensions
- **Smart Decoding**: Intelligent detection of encoded data boundaries
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with comprehensive options
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and informative error messages
- **Padding Management**: Automatic handling of files not divisible by 3 bytes
- **White Background**: Uses white pixels as background, non-white for data

### Technical Details
- Uses RGB pixel values to store 3 bytes per pixel
- Saves images in PNG format for lossless storage
- Automatically adds padding for byte alignment
- Removes padding during decoding process
- Supports files from 1 byte to hundreds of megabytes
- Memory usage scales linearly with file size

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Contributing guidelines for developers
- MIT license for open source use
- Integration test suite for quality assurance
- Development documentation for maintainers
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Code of conduct for community participation

### Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Cross-platform testing on GitHub Actions
- Round-trip integrity verification
- Edge case handling validation
- Performance benchmarking

### Infrastructure
- GitHub repository setup with proper structure
- Continuous Integration with automated testing
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Security scanning for dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Automated test reporting and coverage

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- GUI interface for non-technical users
- Batch processing capabilities
- Progress bars for large file operations
- Support for additional image formats (TIFF, BMP)
- Optional data compression before encoding
- Optional encryption for secure data storage
- Metadata embedding (original filename, timestamp)
- Streaming support for very large files
- Multi-threading for improved performance

### Potential Improvements
- Memory usage optimization for large files
- Better error recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced command-line interface
- Configuration file support
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Docker containerization
- Package manager distribution (pip, conda)

## Migration Guide

### From Version 0.x to 1.0.0
This is the first stable release. If you were using development versions:
- Update command-line arguments (now uses positional arguments)
- The default decoding method is now 'smart' instead of 'count'
- File paths now support spaces and special characters
- Error messages are more descriptive and helpful

## Support
